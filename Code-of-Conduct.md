# Edge Conductor Code of Conduct

The Edge Conductor contributors and maintainers pledge to follow and actively support
the [Cloud Native Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) 
and the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
Both have the goal of fostering an open and welcoming community that treats all people with respect.

In addition, we pledge to follow the documentation, coding and style recommendations for
inclusive writing as demonstrated in
the [Google inclusive documentation stype guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).
This will help ensure that the project's source code and
documentation also supports our goals for an open and welcoming community.
